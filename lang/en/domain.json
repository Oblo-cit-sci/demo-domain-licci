          "LICCI (<a href='https://licci.eu' target='_blank'>https://licci.eu/</a>) is a research project that wants to bring insights from local knowledge to climate research and policy. To do that, LICCI documents and classifies local observations of climate change impacts (e.g., changes in rainfall patterns or impacts of weather changes on wild animal abundance). LICCI has used Oblo technology to create the <a href='https://opentek.eu' target='_blank'>OpenTEK platform</a>"
